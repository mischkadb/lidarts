Lidarts is a free/libre, open-source online darts scoring website.

The project is mostly written in [Python3](https://www.python.org). 
The backend is based on [Flask-Socketio](https://flask-socketio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). 
[gevent](http://www.gevent.org/) workers are managed by [gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/) 
and communicate over [redis](https://redis.io/). 
Data is stored in a [PostgresSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database.
HTTP requests and WebSockets are proxied by [nginx](https://www.nginx.com/).

The entire project is driven by volunteers. Everyone is invited to contribute.
